Amazingly he escapes with his horse and his life, resting briefly before returning to the camp. The rest of the group finds Dekket's horse and Stoutfist calls out Dekket. After alerting the goblin camp to their presence, Womp begins fleeing and making their way to Gramsby as a safe place to make camp for the night.

They sleep in some clouds.",5:"The group discovers that some elemental mephits have taken refuge in their bags. Surprised by this Stoutfist punches one and they all attack. They continue for another day, avoiding a wyvern on the way through careful navigation of the clouds. They come across a large iron and ice comet with an entrance that appears to be a large source of non-elimental material.</br></br>They explore deeper into the land mass and discover a maze of air. Navigating through, they explore one exit, finding a room heavily decorated with pained eyeballs with a small chest in it. Reed, as a snake, opens the vial and accidentally breaks and drinks on of the vials. They manage to recover the other liquid. Further they find a room with sleeping mephits in tubes, which leads into a forge fueled by lava mephits.</br></br>Down a different exit from the maze they discover two pools filled with large tadpole creatures. Drawn out by a dancing light, the tadpoles begin swarming and attack the group. After, Reed finds dormant, unresponsive water mephits at the bottom of each of the pools.</br></br>Afterwards, they moved up the corridor and found two rooms, each with an altar. One had a magical hand print etched into the stone, that reformed to each person's hand as they touched surface, and the other had a well of mysterious gas. Upon placing several items in the gas, and finally Dekket's arm, all the items seemed to disappear. However, under the effects of the potion from earlier, Reed was still able to see them. The mist simply moved the items into the ethereal plane. When Dekket eventually places his hand into the altar, he found that his ethereal hand moved through the stone and activated an ethereal switch, which opened a secret door. They found an ancient tomb and when they removed the lid to the casket, they saw a magical javelin held within, but were immediately attacked by ethereal spiders. After an interesting fight, with Dekket, the spiders, and the rest of Womp in various parts of the ethereal/material realms, the party slew the spiders and took this opportunity to rest.",6:"The group continued to explore the temple in the elemental plane of air, navigating the rest of the trapped maze. They found a strange altar shrine in one of the rooms, with several candles around a very ornate large eye on the walls, with six gemstones around the top of the eye. Connected via hallway, they also discovered a room with many jail cells with the remains of hobgoblins within and a large hole into a cave where some mining had been happening occupied by a giant red frog creature known as a Slaad. They killed the creature in the ensuing battle and discovered blue blood, much like the liquid Gront and Shrump originally discovered in the wizard's tower.</br></br>Finally, they discovered a strange room with a compass rose in the center pointed at four doors, along with the door that they entered, and one other locked on the opposite side. The locked door had a handprint on it, the shape of a Slaad, that when they initially entered, one of the fingers began glowing. Entering the doors on the cardinal directions often involved fighting some elemental creature that spawned from the center of the room. Surely by killing enought of the creatures the final door would open!",7:"Another full day of killing elemental creatures in the cardinal directions room",8:"Eventually, the group returned to the altar and discovered that several of the gemstones above the large eye had been illuminated. Intrigued, the party blew out the candles, which just spawned some smoke mephits. oops. Eventually they returned to the cardinal directions room and were able to randomly go in the correct directions. The reason was that the gemstones above the eye were in the order 'Ruby, Saphire, Jade, Ruby, Saphire, Ruby', the color of each corresponding to an element fire, water, and earth. They party had already discovered that South resulted in fire creatures, East with water, and north with earth. Combining these comes to the order being SENSES, which also was the correct way to solve the final door lock, each finger glowing with each sense applied to the hand.</br></br>The door opened, eventually after the party figured out the senses riddle, and on the other side was a corrupted air elemental with a glowing green gemstone embedded within. Not feeling up to the task, they decided to rest in the temple.",9:"During their time resting they returned to the eye shrine, but discovered that with all the gemstones glowing the eye had parted revealing another door with three wavy lines like they had been seeing throughout the temple along with the inscriptions 2, 1, 3. Returning way back to the memphit rooms with the wind tunnel, they messed around with the three stones in the center that seemed to control the strength of the wind. After several mistakes that sent them flying accross the room, they activated the large pressure plates in the order indicated by the door. This opened the door behind the giant eye and revealed a cloud filled room, where Reed eventually grabbed a magical cloak.</br></br>They returned to fight the corrupted air elemental, which surprised them by having the magical ability to summon lightning and control the wind within the chamber. Eventually, Dekket was able to shoot the gem from the creatures chest, leaving it devoid of magic, and they were able to kill the elemental. Dekket took the gem, and the party, near death, decided to spend one more night in the temple, before going through the portal in the room.",10:"Womp traveled through the portal in the room corrupted air elemental's room and on the other side they found orcs hiding behind hastily crafted barricades, Afraid of Dekket, one orc fled up some stairs, while womp killed the rest of the orcs. Stoutfist discovered that his new javelin turned into lightning and absolutely destroyed one of the orc archers. Giving chase to the orc up the stairs they battled a young blue slaad, until they found the orc chief, who was holding a glowing gem, similar to the one Dekket had taken from the corrupted air elemental. Some of the group fought a young blue slaad until they were able to damage the orc chief, who was forced to stop using the gem. The slaad began to flee, but the orc, now seeing Gront for the first time went into a frenzy with his Greataxe intent on killing the disguised orc. Some members chased the fleeing slaad, forcing it back into combat for a while, while the others desperately fought the Orc chief. Very nearly killing Stoutfist and Gront, eventually they were able to kill the orc, while the slaad fled back into the air elemntal plane. </br></br>Continuing to explore the building they were in, they were eventaully trapped in by several orcs with a balista, forcing them back inside the building. They built a barricade to buy time, which ultimately burned down before charging in and killing the few orc stragglers left on the outside of the entrance to the building. They looked out and found themself on the southern most peak of the five peaks looking down on a huge group of orc encampments. They made their way down the backside of the mountain, avoided a cave with an Ettin inside, before making camp at the base in the trees.</br></br>During the night, Stoutfist, Gront, Dekket, and Jakko had a shared vision of the battle in the past of Mystra's chosen with the aid of Helm battling Bhaal on the mountiain that they currently slept under. In the end, one of the chosen was able to use the Godsbane sword to slay Bhaal, but not before Bhaal was able to rip off the top of the mountain as well as kill 3 of the chosen.",11:"In the morning Dekket found and began to hunt a Couatl, injuring it before losing it in the trees. Eventually they followed a trail of the blood towards a town that had the same structure as Sorenteir. However, it was all just a trap build by the trapper of the peaks, meant to lure them into a recurring living nightmare to feed off of their anguish.",17:"Eclipse of Astrum.</br></br>Stoutfist's batch of dark ale should be ready.",18:"Stoutfist's ale should be ready.",23:"The timeline here is somewhat fuzzy, due to the resetting nature of the town created by the Balhannoth. During their time their they became aquanted with a Dragonborn monk, who aided them in their struggles as well as recieved a gift from Ortho, a still unknown person. After confronting many of the failings of their past, and dealing with the hopeless nature of their existence, they fought the Balhannoth for the final time. Along with the stunning strikes provided by the monk, they were able to kill the Balhannoth, but not before the death of Dekket.",34:"Womp continued on their intended path away from the 'city' towards Reed's druid grove to report back on their findings in the air elemental plane. Shortly after they set up camp for the night, they were approached by a human figure calling himself Ortho. Through a very cordial discussion, Ortho revealed himself as a creature from the nine hells sent by Silgri, Nomog's Iron Shadow, to kill them. Desiring a more fair fight, Ortho gave the group ten days to recover from their ordeal, and prepare for their fight.",35:"After another day of travel, the group arrived at the druid grove, but found it surrounded by a protective barrier of poisonous thorns. Eventually in an animal shape, Reed led the group through the wall discovering that a large part of the grove and surounding area had been destroyed and blighted. They learned that the grove was attacked by some Slaad, and that some of the wellsprings, sources of druidic power in the forest, were being corrupted, as well as reported on the gems that they had found.</br></br>While attempting to investigate one of the green gems, Jakko felt compelled to cut his hand on the Bloodmourne Axe, and found himself unwilling to part with it. Since Dekket, before his death, had a similar affliction and became suicidal as well as attacked Stoutfist in one battle with the Axe, the group felt compelled to keep Jakko from the Axe by force. Ultimately weakening Jakko's resolve for the next day.</br></br>Additionally during the day, they were informed a person was waiting for them that turned out to be Vy, the wife of the now deceased James Dekket. Tensions were high after how much they had been decieved by the Balhannoth, but eventually Vy was able to bury Dekket within the grove.",36:"The group began to investigate the wellsprings, conducting an ancient ritual of purification in order to cleanse one well and save a unicorn guardian Meilikki-Cortos. In payment for the deed, the unicorn was able to free the exhausted Jakko of the curse that held him to the Bloodmourne Axe. Additionally they were able to save Godrin, the ancient treent at the second well, which was being attacked and possessed by some black sludge manifest of the corruption. They sent a letter to Lialle, a leader in the druid camp to inform her of what was happening, an met up with her not long after as they rested.</br></br>Stoutfist sent his horse with Lialle, who instead of travelling back to the grove, went to a cave where the horse was ambushed and killed by trolls. Stoutfist resummoned the horse, who led them back to the cave and they began exploring. After sliding on some of the viscous green goop that covered most of the cave, they were attacked by some rust monsters, which damaged some of their gear, before the group was able to kill them. Finally they came across pools of acid, which turned out to the be sleeping places of the acid trolls that reside within the cave. They didn't realize this until Jakko poked into one with a sword and was immediately pulled into the acid. Already weakened from before, Jakko was quickly killed. A fierce battle ensued with the troll, but the rest of the party was able to escape from the cave.</br></br>This whole ordeal resulted in extremely high tensions and Vy and Stoutfist came to blows, nearing death until Reed stopped the fighting and forced the rest of the group out of the grove.",37:"In the morning, Reed found Vy waiting outside the grove and she showed Reed to where Jakko's arm had been burried the night before. They found Stoutfist and Gront picking up their camp nearby and Stoutfist appologized for his actions. With that, they set off for the Sylvanus-Selunae wellspring.</br></br>They found the three pools of water at this wellspring similarly corrupted and went about their task of conducting a ritual to purify the waters. Eventually through much trial and error, they were able to use the information about the water reacting with the obelisks and the discs, as well as how the obelisks reacted with the disks to find the correct locations in the stone to insert the discs. This triggered lumination of moonlight in the area, removing the corruption, as well as a lightning bolt that struck the altar in the center of the grove. Stoutfist recovered the item that was now resting their, an electricly charged head of a flail.</br></br>Nearing nighttime, they group set off for the grove as a pit stop before heading to the Auril wellspring. Gront learned that only a couple of the obelisks within the Alta Abore appeared active and that the symbols on most of them appeared associated with schools of magic. Reed collected his armor made from the Balhannoth hide and the group left for the final wellspring. While getting closer they heard pained howling but also noticed they were being followed by a pair of trolls. Not wanting to waste time they went forward to the final spring and found a Gray Slaad, a Black Slaad, and Jon Irenicus surrounding an altar with Peter Redstream tied to it being tortured. In the ensuing battle, the trolls ran in seemingly attempting to aid in the fight against the Slaads. Finally, Jon plunged a dagger into Peter's chest before the Slaads, and Jon, left through portals."},Coctus:{1:"Festival of Dreams"},Crusta:{7:"Eclipse of Selune"},Conlegi:{16:"Eclipse of Veneri"},Depostus:{1:"Festival of Lights",5:"Solar Eclipse"},Deliratio:{31:"Eclipse of Astrum"}}},80:function(e,t,o){e.exports=o.p+"static/media/AdjustedWorld.c777fc1d.png"},85:function(e,t,o){e.exports=o(108)},90:function(e,t,o){},91:function(e,t,o){},92:function(e,t,o){},93:function(e,t,o){},94:function(e,t,o){}},[[85,1,2]]]);
